# Description
The goal of this task was to create a scheduler that will allow the user to type in a task, save that task and reload the page with that task still present. I had some trouble getting the task to stay, as well as the alignment of my textboxes. They seem to overlap each other. 

# Previous Repository Failed
 My previous repository was not working at all. I tried to move the documents out of the Assets folder because my pages was publishing my README, instead of my index.html
